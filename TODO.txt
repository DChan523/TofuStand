PROJECT SCOPE: "Tofu Stand" is an online shop where customers are able to purchase
not just tofu but several other products under the MochiRSP banner. Users will need to
set up an account to purchase goods and the "admin" will also require a login to be
able to create/update/delete goods.  Verified users will also be able to leave reviews
on products. Most likely only boostrap will be used for the design. Possibly a bootstrap
theme. In an ideal world I would also get a cart system going which would store
unpurchased goods to checkout later but idk.

TODO:

1. Homepage that displays the products
    1.1 Products should have: - An image
                              - Brief description
                              - Price
                              - *"Purchase/add to cart" button
    1.2 An area for verified user to leave comments(maybe only enable button if logged in)

2. "Checkout" area where users can purchase product
    2.1 Users should be able to specify the quantity of the product they want when adding to cart
    2.2 Users may have to fill out a form with their information(may not do if it's a hassle)

3. Admin area to do basic CRUD operations on product(s)

4. Login and verification thing

5. Make it look cute

-That one login verification thing we did
-Foreign keys and some form of relationship
-Should install composer sometime***
