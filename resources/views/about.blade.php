                    "Who’s joe?" a distant voice asks.

                    Instantly everyone nearby hears the sound of 1,000s of bricks rapidly shuffling towards his location.

                    The earth itself seemed to cry out in agony, until finally the ground itself split open and a horrific creature crawled from the ground, covered in mucus and tar.

                    ”Joe Momma…” the creature whispered.

                    The man cried out in pain as he disintegrated into dust, and the whole world fell silent in fear.

                    "I did a little trolling." the wretched creature remarked before burrowing back into the earth.</p>

                    "touch grass" is not an insult towards gamers, rather it is advice for them. When participating in intense periods
                    of gaming, the human hand has a tendency to get sweaty. The sweat causes the hand to become slick, and it b becomes
                    more difficult to retain a grip on the gamers gaming mouse, thus making it more difficult to perform well in intense
                    gaming moments. By touching grass with the gamers hand, the grass will impart a layer of particulate onto the gamers
                    hand, the particulate can be made of a variety of dusts, dirts and other natural matter. This particulate will then
                    act in a similar form to climbers chalk, absorbing the sweat and drying out the gamers hand. With dry hands, the gamer
                    can now perform to their maximum when gaming. This is why when an enemy or teammate tells you to touch grass, they
                    are simply trying to assist you in performing better.
